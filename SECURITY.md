## Reporting a Vulnerability

All of development is done in the open. Reporting security issues should be done in the open as well. This is a very transparant project. Please use the issues tab, and I'll do my best to incorporate a fix within two days. It helps to add a remedy/fix. It's even better to send a pull request fixing the issue.
